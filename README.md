# Automated-Arch-update
This repository provides a bash script that automates the process of updating and cleaning up an Arch Linux system. By running this script, you can easily keep your system up to date and remove unused packages.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you need to have the following installed on your Arch Linux system:

- `bash`: The bash shell is required to execute the script.
- `sudo`: The script uses `sudo` to run commands with administrative privileges.
- `pacman`: The default package manager for Arch Linux.
- `yay` (optional): If you want to update AUR packages, you need to have `yay` installed. Alternatively, you can modify the script to use a different AUR helper.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Make the script executable by running the following command:
